- [NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM 7](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/)  
nspm-7 directs law enforement agencies to create lists of potential domestic terrorist organizations using several "indicators of violence" which include
  - anti-Americanism
  - anti-capitalism
  - anti-Christianity
  - support for the overthrow of the United States Government
  - extremism on migration
  - extremism on race
  - extremism on gender
  - hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family
  - hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on religion
  - hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on morality

  if you feel that you do now, could in the future, or love someone who fits into these categories _as defined by trump and stephen miller_ this is a very big deal and a radical increase in totalitarian and militaristic repression of opposition.
