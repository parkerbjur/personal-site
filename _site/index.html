nspm-7 directs law enforement agencies to create lists of potential domestic terrorist organizations using several &quot;indicators of violence&quot; which include</p>
<ul>
<li>anti-Americanism</li>
<li>anti-capitalism</li>
<li>anti-Christianity</li>
<li>support for the overthrow of the United States Government</li>
<li>extremism on migration</li>
<li>extremism on race</li>
<li>extremism on gender</li>
<li>hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family</li>
<li>hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on religion</li>
<li>hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on morality</li>
</ul>
<p>if you feel that you do now, could in the future, or love someone who fits into these categories <em>as defined by trump and stephen miller</em> this is a very big deal and a radical increase in totalitarian and militaristic repression of opposition.</p>
